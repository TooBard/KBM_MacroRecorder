# KBM_MacroRecorder
This is a basic user input recorder.  

Main window consists of three buttons, all of which are bound to hotkeys:
* "Start recording" (F1)<addr>
* "Stop recording" (F2)<addr>
* "Playback" (F3)<addr>

This solution uses external class libraries:  
  
[Global mouse and keyboard library](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28064/Global-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Library) (*macro recorder class, playback*)  
  
[globalmousekeyhook](https://github.com/gmamaladze/globalmousekeyhook) (*user input recording*)
